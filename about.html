          <h2>Let's talk about me</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to my studies in software engineering, I am deeply
            passionate about spiritual hymns and movies. Hymns provide me with a
            sense of peace and reflection, as their powerful messages and
            melodies help me stay grounded. Movies, on the other hand, fuel my
            creativity and offer an escape into different worlds. I enjoy a wide
            range of genres, particularly those that tell meaningful stories and
            explore human emotions. These hobbies offer me both spiritual
            enrichment and creative inspiration, balancing my technical pursuits
            with personal growth.
